solutions-mobile-backend-starter-android-client
=====================================

This project is an Android native client sample for Mobile Backend Starter (MBS, https://developers.google.com/cloud/samples/mbs/).
It's a fork of the official MBS aimed to be pushed out to the Playstore to server as a working verion for anyone to try.
It has a project ID, security ClientID and everything else already setup and thus configured to speak to a specific MBS backend.
If you want to use a different backend or play with the code, prefer this original source :
